Flex is used for the nav bar because it allows more tabs to be easily added to the nav bar without needing to do much, if any, styling changes. Tabs have a higher chance of changing than the layout of a page and flexbox allows for more flexibility when doing this. The same reasoning goes for my use of flexbox for the related article titles on the right hand side of the page. I used grid for the layout of the main content of the page because the content in the examples followed the layout of a grid quite closely, making it easy for me to replicate it. The boxes from the grid allow an appealing organization of information on the page, something flexbox isn't very good at doing, since flexbox molds itself around the information instead of making information adhere to a certain layout.
